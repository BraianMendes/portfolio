  "description": "POC web app using Next.js, Tesseract.js (OCR), and Compromise (NLP) to read, interpret, and standardize information extracted from medical prescriptions in image format. Automates the reading and understanding of prescriptions using AI, making the process faster, safer, and less prone to human error.",
  "overview": "Automates the reading and understanding of medical prescriptions using artificial intelligence. Uses advanced NLP techniques to interpret extracted texts, even with writing variations, OCR errors, or different prescription formats.",
  "howItWorks": [
    "User uploads a prescription image.",
    "Text extraction with Tesseract.js (OCR).",
    "Text normalization and processing with Compromise (NLP), identifying drug name, dosage, and quantity.",
    "Standardization of drug names and return of structured data.",
    "Uses a local and simplified database for simulation only."
  ],
  "nlpHighlights": "The project's differential is the use of NLP to interpret the extracted text, going beyond simple reading. Compromise allows the identification of patterns, drug names, and quantities, even with common OCR or handwriting errors.",
