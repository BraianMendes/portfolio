    "description": "Proof of Concept (POC) web app built with Next.js, demonstrating OCR and NLP to read, interpret, and standardize information from medical prescriptions in image format. Automates reading and understanding prescriptions using AI, making the process faster, safer, and less prone to human error. Uses Tesseract.js for OCR and compromise for NLP to extract and normalize drug names, dosages, and quantities, even with writing variations or OCR errors. Not intended for production or real medical use.",
